# CogoPortHomePage
This is the home page of Cogoport created using only HTML and CSS. It was a great learning exercise as it helped me to play around with flex properties, animation,
marquee and many other css styles.
I faced difficulty in making it responsive at first but later on I found out that was because I had gone for inline styling in many places.
I just have not added the dropdown menu in navbar,footer in mobile-view but I will do it soon after picking on the JS functions as soon as possible.
